The suffix used for all measurements given is Kharon, which appears to be the same length as their bodies would have been based on door sizes. One Kharon appears to be approximately 3 meters.\nPrefixes indicate different magnitudes, similar to our metric system. Not all of these were successfully translated.\n\nTo indicate time, they appear to be using the degradation time of certain objects, however highly accelerated.\nThe following, possibly inaccurate time measurements have been translated:\nPlant - 23 minutes\nStone - 1.5 days\nStar - 2.4 months\nArc - 12 years",
